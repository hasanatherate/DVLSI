**Analog Design Steps in Cadence Virtuoso (for DVLSI)**

1. **Create a New Library**:  
   Open Virtuoso and go to **File → New → Library**. Choose **gpdk180** and click **OK**.

Create Library: File > New > Library, name it (e.g., ATMECE), attach to gpdk180.
Create Cell View: Under the library, create a new cell view (e.g., inv) and open schematic editor.
Add Components: Add PMOS and NMOS from gpdk180, and create pins (VDD, VSS, Vin, Vout).
Wire Circuit: Connect components using the Wire Narrow Tool per the schematic diagram.
Check and Save: Verify the schematic with Check and Save to ensure no errors.
Create Test Bench: File > New > Cell View, name it (e.g., inverter_TB), and create a symbol.
Add Sources: Add inverter symbol, voltage sources (Vpulse, VDC), ground, and output pin.
Run Simulation: Launch ADE L, configure transient (200ns) and DC analysis (0-1.8V), and select outputs.
View Results: Run simulation to view transient and DC responses, then save and close.

Log in to the analog account and open the terminal.
Change the directory and start Virtuoso using the relevant command.
Create a library in Virtuoso, attach it to the gpdk 180 technology library.
Create a cell view under the library and assign a schematic view.
Place PMOS and NMOS transistors in the schematic from the gpdk 180 library.
Add input and output pins (vdd, vss, vin, vout) to the schematic.
Connect the components using wires and validate the connections.
Create a symbol for the schematic with correct pin placements.
Design a test circuit by placing the inverter symbol in a new cell view.
Add voltage sources (Vpulse and VDC) and ground components to the test circuit.
Name input/output lines and validate the test circuit.
Perform transient and DC analysis using ADE, specifying simulation parameters.
Plot input/output waveforms and adjust parameters for DC response.
Run parametric analysis to analyze the impact of variations.
Calculate delay and intersection values from simulation results.
