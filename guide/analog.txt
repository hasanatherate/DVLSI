**Analog Design Steps in Cadence Virtuoso (for DVLSI)**

1. **Create a New Library**:  
   Open Virtuoso and go to **File → New → Library**. Choose **gpdk180** and click **OK**.

Create Library: File > New > Library, name it (e.g., ATMECE), attach to gpdk180.
Create Cell View: Under the library, create a new cell view (e.g., inv) and open schematic editor.
Add Components: Add PMOS and NMOS from gpdk180, and create pins (VDD, VSS, Vin, Vout).
Wire Circuit: Connect components using the Wire Narrow Tool per the schematic diagram.
Check and Save: Verify the schematic with Check and Save to ensure no errors.
Create Test Bench: File > New > Cell View, name it (e.g., inverter_TB), and create a symbol.
Add Sources: Add inverter symbol, voltage sources (Vpulse, VDC), ground, and output pin.
Run Simulation: Launch ADE L, configure transient (200ns) and DC analysis (0-1.8V), and select outputs.
View Results: Run simulation to view transient and DC responses, then save and close.
